# Aeroponics
A soilless cultivation technique where plant roots are suspended in air and misted with nutrient-rich solutions. This method optimizes nutrient and oxygen uptake, leading to accelerated plant growth and higher yields compared to traditional soil-based .

Problem statment:
“To design and develop an IoT-based Aeroponics system that automates the monitoring and control of key plant growth parameters, reduces manual intervention, optimizes resource usage, and provides real-time remote accessibility to users."
